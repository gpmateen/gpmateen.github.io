This is my first [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site. I'm going with the default themes and settings since i'm very new to this, i'm not messing with lot of configurations and other options. Let's build them up as we go along and make the site more customized.

Again a big shout out to everyone who is new to web/software development and wanting to learn this skills. You don't have to be an expert at this to do web development, well You'd never become an expert at anything, you'd just be knowledgeable probably more knowledgeable than most of us out there.

Hence the central idea of my blog [`sudoers`](https://gpmateen.github.io/), we are cannot become `root` or won't be given with `root` priviledges to begin with. So we start off with [`sudoers`](https://gpmateen.github.io/), like the saying goes, you fake it until you make it.

So this is my humble effort to fake it until I make it out there.
